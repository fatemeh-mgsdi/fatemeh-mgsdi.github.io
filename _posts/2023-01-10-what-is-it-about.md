As a developer, dependant or independant of languages, frameworks or tools we're using, we come up to many different situations, problems or technical questions which we have no idea how to solve. Sometimes we wonder why a piece of code's not working, or in contrast, why it's working! We all face different challenges at work, that we might think we are the only one who's facing it, but after sharing and talking about that with the right community, you'll know that you're not alone and dozens of people are experiencing that feeling.

The truth is, everyone's facing these challenges and I'm not an exception!<br>
At first, I started using Google Doc as a place to keep my own writings, solutions and everything that helps me to keep track of software development over time. After a while, by looking back to all those notes I've saved, I felt I could use it to help other people and that encouraged me to start my own blog; So I'm here to talk about technical stuff, how to solve a specific problem or even the challenges of  working as freelancer or participating in a large team and etc. . Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting. 

I firmly believe that blogs are a two way conversation, so I welcome any suggestions â€“ as long as they're on topic, more or less. So, let me know if there's anything you wanna talk about by:
